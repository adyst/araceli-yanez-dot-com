Note: I cannot publicly disclose the code for this project.

For some background, test programs are a collection of files that are  used by Automated Test Equipment, or equipment that is used when testing integrated circuits in a production environment. Multiple companies use this type of equipment and methodology.

The objective for the transformer was to take two test programs with completely different structures and format an output that could be easily compared in a diff tool. I really wanted to be diligent about the design of this application than I had with others in the past, for several reasons. First, the creation of this application would be the first of its kind and could grow into something used frequently by multiple audiences. Second, the integrity of data and how it was interpreted was important to core purpose for this application. And third, I wanted to become a better software engineer. 

I ended up selecting Java for its cross-platform capabilities and the future option of importing this tool into other existing Java applications in our portfolio. The application underwent code reviews as well, which was a nice experience. I used to think that I would be defensive or scared about getting my code reviewed by someone else, but when it finally happened, it was a fun learning moment rather than a court hearing. Overall, from a SDLC standpoint, this was a great learning experience and, while not perfect, I'm proud of the end result.
