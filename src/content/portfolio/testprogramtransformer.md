Note: I cannot publicly disclose the code for this project.

For some background, test programs are a collection of files that are  used by Automated Test Equipment, or equipment that is used when testing  integrated circuits in a production environment. Multiple companies use  this type of equipment. My team created test programs as part of our  support portfolio.

The objective for the transformer was to take two test programs with completely different structures and format an output that could be easily compared in a diff tool. I really wanted to be diligent about the design of this application, more to maintain the integrity of the data to compare, than the programming approach. The design went through a few reviews from multiple types of stakeholders and software engineers. I ended up selecting Java for its cross-platform capabilities and the future option of importing this tool into other existing Java applications in our portfolio.
