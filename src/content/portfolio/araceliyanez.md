For the longest time, my website had an "under construction" sign on the front page. If I was going to proclaim myself to be a web developer, that wouldn't do. So, I decided to dust it off and take the opportunity to learn something fun: Gatsby, with React and GraphQL.

Gatsby is a static site generator, which was an important requirement since I wanted to eventually push this to GitHub pages. Coming from using Angular for the past few months, React was refreshingly light. I just had to worry about the view - scaffolding the website and deciding the component architecture took little time. For the GraphQL bit, I watched a video tutorial going over the basics by Eve Porcello. The entire time I was thinking, probably naively, "Why hasn't this taken over the world yet?". GraphQL helped to query local Markdown posts and convert them over to pages in the final Gatsby build.

Design, in general, takes the longest for me. I could sit all day changing colors and pushing around pixels, to eventually slap my wrist and ration myself from changing anything else. The spheres on the splash background were initially supposed to represent a universe, but I dropped that idea because I needed more color in my life.
